This Adventures in Middle Earth character sheet is a modified version of Roll20's 5e OGL sheet, which can be found at https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/5th%20Edition%20OGL%20by%20Roll20 .
(There is a wiki here: https://wiki.roll20.net/5th_Edition_OGL_by_Roll20)

It has removed the Arcana skill, and instead added the following, as per Cubicle7's Player Guide:
1. Lore
2. Riddle
3. Shadow Lore
4. Traditions

Additionally, many of the translation entries were modified, added, or deleted, in line with the Player's Guide, and Loremaster's Guide. Examples include:

1. Feat --> Virtues
2. Races --> Cultures
3. Personality Traits --> Distinctive Qualities.

The sheet also has the PG and DMG's base classes in place of the 5e classes, with automatically changing saving throw proficiencies and class resource labels. Every class also has 3 additional entries in the repeating resources section:

1. Shadow (with the Permanent label instead of total)
2. Exhaustion
3. Position (to denote Guide etc. on Journeys)

The spell list has been disabled, but all code related to the page itself is still intact.

You can see a full to-do list in the issues tracker, including but not limited to:
1. Auto shadow weakness selector.
2. Spell toggle???
